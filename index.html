      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee" target="_blank" title="커피의정의"><strong>Coffee </strong></a> is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain Coffea species.
      When coffee berries turn from green to bright red in color – indicating ripeness – they are picked, processed, and dried.[2] Dried coffee seeds (referred to as "beans") are roasted to varying degrees, depending on the desired flavor.
      Roasted beans are ground and then brewed with near-boiling water to produce the beverage known as coffee.
